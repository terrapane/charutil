# Character Utilities Library

This library contains various functions to make it easier to work with certain
character strings.

At present, the library defines the following three functions:

* `ConvertUTF8ToUTF16()`
* `ConvertUTF16ToUTF8()`
* `IsUTF8Valid()`

Each of these functions exists in the `Terra::CharUtil` namespace.
